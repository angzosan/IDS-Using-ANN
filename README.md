# IDS-Using-ANN
This implementation  uses a neural network in order to determine the "type" of a signal. It uses supervised learning  ( = Applications in which the training data comprises examples of the input vectors along with their corresponding target vectors are known as supervised learning problemsâ€” Page 3, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, 2006. ) and based on the information it gathered during the training process it analyzes the testing data and provides an ouput.

Database tested : KDD Cup'99 -> 10% out of which 80% was used for training and 20% for testing.
